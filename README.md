# hw4API
The project needs to be started with html, a style sheet using CSS and javascript
An event listener function should be added to the button
using javascript you will create a quiz with correct responses and incorrect responses being saved in local storage.
Once the interface user inputs the desired information, 
an API call will occur and at the end of the quiz the local storage data will be accessed using the API to pull the data to create a result of win or loss
this is how the API "call" will be answered
